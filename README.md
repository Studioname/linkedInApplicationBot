# linkedInApplicationBot
A bot for applying for junior python developer jobs

Had it working nicely up to the point where it became impossible to click the discard button. I should have taken a break, but stupidly carried on coding. Eventually found a
way to click the discard button, and then started to introduce error handling. Then everything broke and linkedin flagged my bot, so it couldn't log in anymore. So I could no longer
test my code. I pulled a previous version, added the error handling and that was that. Was going swimmingly well until I saw the light at the end of the tunnel and said to myself 'I won't take a break because
I'm almost done'. This is not the way to approach things - It starts out with a small error, but by the end you have a pile of spaghetti and no idea why it won't work anymore [when
the initial problem was fairly simple to solve.] BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT! The code is 90% functional but I don't have the inclination to make another account - The lesson to be learned
is to take breaks even if you're close to finished.

Update: Success! I pulled the first version I uploaded to git and worked on that instead. Took some edge cases and error handling but it mostly works! It's nice to get the thing working =)
